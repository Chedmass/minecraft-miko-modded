# miko-magic
Repository with minecraft launcher for Miko-Magic modded server

## Usage
    If you don't have licensed minecraft launcher, you may download this launcher with all mods ready to connect to Miko-Magic modded server.
    Also, if you wish to use different launcher, you can download mods folder (Minecraft for Miko-Magic\minecraft\game\mods) and add it to your 1.7.10 forge minecraft installation.
    If you have licensed minecraft launcher though, you should download CurseForge and use it to download this modpack, it'll be much more stable and safe.
